# unsupported-videos

HFS plugin to expand the SHOW command so that, for unsupported video files, a streaming-conversion is started. 
This can be heavy on the CPU of the server, so please configure restrictions.

For this to work, you have to install ffmpeg. Configure the "ffmpeg path" option to specify where ffmpeg is installed.

If you haven't yet, [download this](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip),
and unzip only the file `ffmpeg.exe` that you'll find in the `bin` folder.
